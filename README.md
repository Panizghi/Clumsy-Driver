# Clumsy Driver
The idea is simple! Working as a delivery driver where the player has to pick up packages ( red boxes) and deliver them to different spots of the city :). Bumping into any item such as rock trees and houses will speed your car down Booster will increase your speed! The color of the car will change during the time you pick up a package and when you drop it off. Keep in mind you can only pick up one package at a time.
